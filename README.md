## Methodology

Whether consumers are looking for a new recipe or watching their favorite foodie celebrity, food is thriving on YouTube. This past year Google has seen a growth of 280% in food channel subscriptions. ​

This growing trend is what inspired the creation of our app: What is the  Recipe?

Our app allows users to explore new recipes from various cuisines. If the user doesn’t know what they are looking for, they can click the top trending food images located on the main page for inspiration.​

Feel free to submit any features you'd like to see via the Issues section of this GitHub repo.
